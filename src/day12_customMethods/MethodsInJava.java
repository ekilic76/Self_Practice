    METHODS IN JAVA
    . java methods
            1)Standard Library Methods
            2)User defined methods
                    2.1) static methods
                    2.2) Instance methods

   METHODS
    . It is a function
    . Grouping a series of code fragments to perform a task
    . Allows us to reuse the function rather than repating same set of statements
    EXP:
                        displayMessage();
                        eat();

    Declaring a method
     public static void displayMessage(){
     method body
     }

     ACCESS MODIFIER: determines the visibility, public is open to the world and always accessible
     STATIC MODIFIER: Allows us to call the method through the class name
     RETURN TYPE: determines if the method returns a value. if return type is Void,method does not return any value.
     METHOD NAME: Descriptive name of the function, The same rules that apply to variable names also apply to method names.
     Parenthesis: Method name is always fallowed by a set of parenthesis, can be capable of receiving arguments.

     CALLING A METHOD
        . When we need to script to perform the task the method does
        . The method executes the code in that code block
        . When it has finished, the code continues to run from the point where it was initially called

        PARAMETERS
        Passing Arguments to Method
            . When we declare a method, PARAMETERS can be given
            . Parameters passed to the methods act like variables
            . Used for providing additional information the method must have to perform its task

        Calling Method That Need Information
            . Must specify the values the method, parameters can be given
            . Values need to be given in the paranthesis that fallows method name
            . The values we passed to the method are called arguments
            . Arguments can be provided as values or as variables


            // create a method that can check if a person is eligible to buy alcohol  (age)


    // create a method that can check if a number is odd, or even or zero (number)


    // create a method that can calculate the grade of the students  (score)


    // create a method that can print the maximum number between two numbers, if both are equal then it prints "Equal", (num1, num2)


    //Create a method that can display the initials of a person  (firstName, lastName)

        /*
        firstname = "Cydeo"
        lastname = "School"
        initial ==> C.S
         */
