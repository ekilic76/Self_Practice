Hard Coding
    . Hardcoding means to assign value directly in the code.
    .Hardcoding is something to avoid in most cases
    .The opposite would be dynamic, when the value of something is coming from outside of the code(could be from a different
    file like text file, excel file or even different source like browser or database)
    . Imagine you are gathering information about a person's name. The name would be hardcoded if you typing "james"
    directly into the code instead of dynamically getting the information from outside the code.
